Some Notes on Fieldwork in South-West Montreal
======
I have been involved in a local social project in the South-West Montreal since the beginning of the pandemic. Our aim is to alleviate the social isolation of low income seniors living alone. I tried to use some data analysis to guide us to identify the low income seniors. I made use of public data resources such as [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/), [Montréal Données Ouvertes](https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/logements-sociaux) and [Census Canada](https://census.gc.ca/index-eng.htm). 

Social Housing in Montreal: An Analysis Using the Data from Montréal Données Ouvertes (IN FRENCH)
======
There is a huge need for social housing in Quebec [Social housing crisis -Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1771979/logement-social-crise-montreal-quebec-gatineau) and the needs are constantly increasing due to the real estate speculation of the last decades [Real estate speculation - IRIS](https://cdn.iris-recherche.qc.ca/uploads/publication/file/Spe_culation_immobilie_re_-_Logement_locatif_WEB.pdf).

You can read the whole analysis [here](https://onatekinci.github.io/logements_sociaux/).
